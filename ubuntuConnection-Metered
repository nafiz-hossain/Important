Get device's current connection

nmcli -t -f GENERAL.CONNECTION --mode tabular device show $DEVICE | head -n1

-t is required as there is a space appended at the end otherwise (!?).

Show current metered status

nmcli -f connection.metered connection show $CONNECTION

Where $CONNECTION is the string returned by the previous command.

Change metered status

The valid statuses are yes, no, and unknown. unknown is the default, which will do the guessing based on things like DHCP option ANDROID_METERED (reference).

Example: set $CONNECTION to be metered:

nmcli connection modify $CONNECTION connection.metered yes
